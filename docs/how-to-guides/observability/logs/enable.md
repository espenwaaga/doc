# Enable logging

This guide will show you how to enable logging in your application.

Configure your application to log to console \(stdout/stderr\).
If you want more information than just the log message \(loglevel, MDC, etc\), you should log in JSON format; the fields you provide will then be indexed.

See [Example log configuration](../../../reference/logs-example.md) for configuration help
