### NAIS Doc authoring guide

This guide is a highly compressed summary of the doc theory published at [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

## Diátaxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs.

To create contents you must determine what you are setting out to do. Are you writing a tutorial, a How-to guide, a comprehensive explanantion of a concept or is it a reference.

* Tutorial 
	* A tutorial is an experience that takes place under the guidance of a tutor. A tutorial is always learning-oriented.
* How-to
	* How-to guides are directions that guide the reader through a problem or towards a result. How-to guides are goal-oriented.
*Reference
	* Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference material is information-oriented.

* Explanation
	* Explanation is a discusive treatment of a subject, that permits reflection. Explanation is understanding-oriented.
